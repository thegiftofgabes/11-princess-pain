<p>i will say this as bluntly as i know how: i am a transsexual, and
therefore, i am a monster. (<em>susan stryker – my words to victor

<p><strong><em>a word of warning</em></strong>:</p>
<p>this book contains <strong><em>bodies</em></strong>. <em>lots</em> of
bodies, both referenced and illustrated. some of those bodies are
<strong><em>naked</em></strong>. some of them are
<strong><em>monstrous</em></strong>,
<strong><em>grotesque</em></strong>, <strong><em>horrific</em></strong>,
in many different ways. they were not made with the purpose of being
offensive, but if any of that makes you <em>uncomfortable</em> or
<em>disturbed</em>, be advised to proceed with caution. there are also
mentions of <strong><em>neonazis</em></strong>,
<strong><em>billionaires</em></strong>,
<strong><em>aristocrats</em></strong> and
<strong><em>cops</em></strong>, all of which are supposed to be punched.
on the other hand, here there be no <strong><em>elves</em></strong> or
<strong><em>spiders</em></strong> whatsoever.</p>
<section id="ch001.xhtml#a-premise" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1">A PREMISE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This game assumes an explicitly queer and anti-capitalist take on the
Urban Fantasy genre. You don’t need to be queer to enjoy it, but i don’t
think capitalists are gonna have much fun here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter what they tell you, there’s still
<strong>weirdness</strong> and <strong>wonder</strong> everywhere. You
just have to know where to look. At the edges and cracks of
‘<em>normal</em>’ life we exist, we persist, and we
<strong>resist</strong>: the <strong>monsters</strong>, the
<strong>magicians</strong>, the <strong>anomalies</strong>, the
<strong>freaks</strong>, and the <strong>outcasts</strong>. We gather in
the shadows, trying our best to live our lives in a world that, when it
doesn’t exactly fear or hate us, doesn’t even <strong>believe</strong>
in our existence.</p>
<p>Yes, I know this <em>can</em> be a metaphor for queer experience, but
it’s not <em>just</em> that. This is about the
<strong>monstrous</strong>, the <strong>abnormal</strong>, and the
<strong>weird</strong>, in <em>any</em> flavour you want, not as
something to be feared but to be <strong>cherished</strong> and
<strong>protected</strong>.</p>
<p>Alas, there are people out there who can’t stand this. They work from
behind the scenes to protect ‘<strong>normality</strong>’ at all costs.
This means getting rid of us, by any means necessary. They are often
successful, but not as much as they’d like. Even so, they are
resourceful, and they’re good at what they do.</p>
<p>There are also those who would use the magical and the unusual for
their own purposes, be it <strong>profit</strong>,
<strong>knowledge</strong> or <strong>power</strong> (which, one could
argue, are the <em>same thing</em> in the end). These are even more
<strong>dangerous</strong> when they manage to get what they want.</p>
<p>But we’re still here. We’re not going anywhere. <em><strong>And we
fight back</strong></em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="ch001.xhtml#a-beginning" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2">A BEGINNING</h2>
<p>You are all members of an <strong>organisation</strong> dedicated to
protecting the weird, the monstrous, the anomalous, and the magical. You
are also, in some way or another, <em>weird, monstrous, abnormal</em>,
<em>anomalous,</em> or <em>magical</em> yourselves. Preferably <em>for
me</em>, you’re a bunch of anarcho-communist queers as well, but you do
you, no judgement. Just know that <strong>no bigots</strong> of any kind
are allowed to play this game, at the risk of being
<strong>hexed</strong>, <strong>cursed</strong> and otherwise
<strong>jinxed</strong>. Remember: <em>no bigots, only
bigfoots</em>.</p>
<p>Your group is not <em>all-powerful</em>. It is not associated with
any <em>government</em> or <em>corporation</em>. It is definitely not
structured in a <em>militaristic</em> or <em>hierarchical</em> model. It
does not have stuff like a ‘<em>budget</em>’ or ‘<em>orders from the
higher-ups</em>’. It <em>is</em>, however, organised and coordinated; it
<em>has</em> to be. It was created with some goals in mind:
<strong>protect</strong> others like you from persecution and
exploitation by people like <em>The Bureau</em> or <em>The
Brotherhood</em> (more on those later), <strong>prevent</strong> stupid
assholes (like nazis) from using magic to achieve their nefarious goals,
and overall, <em>keep the world <strong>weird</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This game is, in a way, a response to a lot of things. Most of all,
<em>Hellboy</em> (and the BPRD) and the <em>SCP Foundation</em>, but
also books by Neil Gaiman (particularly <em>American Gods</em>,
<em>Anansi Boys</em>, <em>Neverwhere</em> and <em>The Books of
Magic</em>), Charles Stross (<em>The Laundry Files</em> series) and
China Miéville (specifically <em>Kraken</em>), and games like <em>Delta
Green</em> or the <em>World of Darkness</em> universe. Some of it was
taken from a forgotten <em>Dresden Files RPG</em> campaign I planned
many years ago and some of it came from the notes for a novel I’m
writing as a middle finger to some transphobic fantasy writers. It’s
also influenced by getting annoyed at how many nazis there are in occult
circles. Overall, it’s my take on the <strong>Urban Fantasy</strong>
genre and its tropes, while feeling <em>monstrous</em> myself. It’s
taking bits and pieces from all those different things and stitching
together a monster in my own fractured image.</p>
<p>This is a game about monsters, anomalies, magicians and other weirdos
fighting back and protecting the oppressed against those who would
exploit and erase them. And punching nazis, of course, for <em>all nazis
must be punched</em>.</p>
<p>Ok, moving on.</p>
<p>Before starting the game, discuss the need for <strong>safety
tools</strong>, which are tools that facilitate the creation of a
comfortable and safe environment for <em>all</em> of you. I like the
<em>Lines and Veils</em> system and the <em>X-Card</em>, but choose
whatever suits you best. Most of all, be <strong>kind</strong> and
<strong>trust</strong> each other.</p>
<p>Next step is creating a <strong>manifesto</strong> together: take
turns declaring an element, <em>any</em> element, you’d like to either
<em>have</em> or <em>not</em> have in your game. For example, I want
<em>meat witches</em>, you don’t want <em>cellphones</em>, she wants
<em>tentacles</em> or they don’t want <em>capitalism</em>. In any case
of disagreements, state your arguments and have a vote. Or flip a coin.
Whatever works for you. The list is finished when someone says something
like “<em>ok, I think we have enough already</em>.”</p>
<p>Finally, decide which one of you will play as the person
formerly-known-as-GM / DM / Referee / whatever, who mediates conflicts,
calls for rolls, narrates the adventures and plays the NPCs. Come up
with a title for them. I’ll call them the <strong>Organizer</strong> for
now.</p>
</section>
<section id="ch001.xhtml#your-character" class="level2"
data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3">YOUR CHARACTER</h2>
<p>Come up with a <strong>name</strong> and/or a
<strong>callsign</strong> for your character, what the others can call
them, and the <strong>pronouns</strong> they use.</p>
<p>Think of a <strong>background</strong> for your character: what did
they do before this story began? Alternatively, you can also roll
<strong>1d100</strong> on a list of <strong>premade backgrounds</strong>
below.</p>
<p>Describe what your character <strong>looks</strong> like. Ask another
player to give a small <strong>detail</strong> they think is fitting for
your character. Use it if you like it, or twist it in your own image if
you don’t.</p>
<p>Assign <strong>two tags</strong> for <strong>each</strong> of the
following verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>BE</strong>: anything that significantly
<strong>defines</strong> your character. (e.g., ‘<em>deeply
empathetic</em>’, ‘<em>amateur coroner</em>’, ‘<em>none more goth</em>’,
‘<em>life of the party</em>’ etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HAVE</strong>: anything important that your character
<strong>carries</strong> with them, <em>literally or not</em>. (e.g.,
‘<em>my mother’s sword</em>’, ‘<em>a worn grimoire</em>’, ‘<em>a broken
heart</em>’, ‘<em>the hopes of my people</em>’ etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DO</strong>: anything your character <strong>knows
how</strong> to do especially well. (e.g., ‘<em>car theft</em>’,
‘<em>kung fu fighting</em>’, ‘<em>talking myself out of trouble</em>’,
‘<em>eating literally anything</em>’ etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tags are <em>not</em> rigid. You can <strong>HAVE</strong> ‘friends
in high places’, or you can <strong>BE</strong> ‘friends with
influential people’, for example.</p>
<p>If you want your character to use Magic, you need a <strong>MAGIC
TAG</strong>. That means one of your tags (BE, HAVE or DO, you choose)
should <strong>explicitly state</strong> that you can use Magic in some
way. More on how magic works in the ‘<em>Our Game</em>’ section.</p>
<section id="ch001.xhtml#optional-mechanics" class="level4"
data-number="1.3.0.1">
<h4 data-number="1.3.0.1">OPTIONAL MECHANICS</h4>
<p>If you’re playing a <strong>campaign</strong> or
<strong>longer</strong> <strong>game</strong>, you can use the following
guidelines for advancing <strong>character arcs</strong>: define
<strong>two</strong> things your character <strong>WANTS</strong> and
<strong>one</strong> thing they <strong>NEED</strong>.</p>
<p>Their <strong>WANTS</strong> represent their <strong>conscious
objectives</strong>. Their <strong>NEED</strong> represents something
that they <em>have</em> to <strong>go through</strong>, but not
necessarily something they <em>want</em> or consciously <em>know</em>
about, in order to grow and give their story a satisfying
‘<strong>ending</strong>’. These are <em>not</em> fixed and can
<strong>change</strong> as you play and as the story leads you to places
you didn’t anticipate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Examples of <strong>wants</strong></em>: avenge the death of
my parents; become the master of my craft; find a cure for my
affliction; learn the secrets of the old world etc.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Examples of <strong>needs</strong></em>: overcome a trauma;
learn to care for the smaller things in life; accept myself; find
forgiveness etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your character gets what they <strong>need</strong>
<em>before</em> getting what they <strong>want</strong>, they can either
<strong>retire</strong> in peace or receive a
<strong>revelation</strong> that will make all <strong>rolls</strong>
related to their <strong>wants</strong> <strong>easier</strong>
(<em>explained below</em>).</p>
<p>If your character gets both their <strong>wants</strong>
<em>without</em> getting what they <strong>need</strong>, their wants
will turn out to be not as satisfying as imagined and you can either
<strong>give up</strong> and retire your character or make them go
through their <strong>darkest hour</strong> (<em>see below</em>) to
receive a revelation that will make all <strong>rolls</strong> related
to their <strong>need</strong> <strong>easier</strong> (<em>explained
below</em>).</p>
<p>Whenever you want (or need), define your character’s <strong>darkest
hour</strong>. This is the <strong>lowest point</strong> in their story,
the inevitable moment where they have to face their <strong>deepest
fears</strong>. You can choose to <strong>play</strong> it out or just
<strong>narrate</strong> it, whatever works for you.</p>
<p>Both <strong>WANTS</strong> and <strong>NEEDS</strong> have
<strong>Beats</strong>. Beats are <strong>steps</strong> your character
has to take in order to get what they <strong>want</strong> and what
they <strong>need</strong>. Beats are not necessarily the same as
successes or achievements, they are <em>narratively</em> important
<strong>moments,</strong> and can even include <em>failures</em> and
defeats. When playing, assign <strong>4 beats</strong> to
<strong>each</strong> of your <strong>wants</strong> and your
<strong>need</strong>. Every time you <strong>reach a beat</strong> you
can <strong>change</strong> all the other remaining
<strong>beats</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>one</strong> of your
<strong>tags</strong> for something else, if you can <em>justify</em>
how that makes sense in the story.</p>
<p><em>You <strong>don’t</strong> need to start with any of your beats
already written.</em></p>
<p>When you <strong>reach</strong> a beat, cross it out.
<strong>Each</strong> beat crossed makes the <strong>rolls</strong>
related to reaching the <strong>next</strong> beat in the list
<strong>harder</strong>, in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>After BEAT 1</strong>: roll <strong>3d6</strong>, take
the two <strong>lowest</strong> results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>After BEAT 2</strong>: roll <strong>2d6</strong>,
<strong>minus 1</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>After BEAT 3</strong>: roll <strong>2d6</strong>,
<strong>minus 2</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each beat crossed also makes <strong>easier</strong> the
<strong>rolls</strong> related to their respective
<strong>wants</strong> or <strong>need</strong> that could end in
<strong>dying</strong> or <strong>quitting:</strong> roll <strong>2d6 +
1d6</strong> for <strong>each</strong> beat, take the two
<strong>highest</strong> values.</p>
<p>The wants and needs system is intended to provide you with open-ended
long-term goals, but if it still feels too <em>restrictive</em> for you,
here’s an <strong>alternative</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t worry about <em>general</em> wants and needs. Instead, come up
with <strong>2 short-term beats</strong> for things your character
<strong>wants</strong>, and <strong>1</strong> for what you think they
<strong>need</strong>. When you <strong>reach</strong> a beat,
<strong>cross</strong> it off and come up with the <strong>next</strong>
one. <em>Everything else</em> works the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you create your characters, describe <em>how they met</em>, how
and when did they <em>join the group</em>, and <em>what unites them</em>
beyond their missions.</p>

<section id="ch001.xhtml#character-backgrounds" class="level3"
data-number="1.3.1">
<h3 data-number="1.3.1">CHARACTER BACKGROUNDS</h3>
<p>The suggested backgrounds give you ideas for your
<strong>tags</strong> and if/why you can use <strong>Magic</strong>. A
few of them also include custom <strong>mechanics</strong>. Those are
just <strong>suggestions</strong>, do what you want with them.</p>
<p>If you’re only interested in the more <em>regular</em> human
character backgrounds, roll <strong>1d20</strong>. If you want to open
it up a little for more <em>supernatural</em> options, roll
<strong>2d20</strong> and add them together. If you want <em>all</em>
the options, roll <strong>1d100</strong>.</p>

<p>You have a <em>humanoid</em> upper body and an <em>equine</em> lower

You may have horns or a beard, regardless of gender. Are you really good

<p>You were <em>swapped</em>, either taken or left behind, by

fit in? If left behind, did someone notice anything different about you?
Did you ever meet your original family? Where and who is your

<p>You’re <em>supposedly</em> an <em>immortal witch</em> with the face

misbehaved <em>children</em> and make jewellery from their

<p>You have <em>some</em> connection to <em>dragons</em>, however vague
that sounds. What is this connection? Maybe you’re a half-dragon hybrid?
Were you created, born, or transformed? By the way, do dragons still
<em>exist</em> in this world? If yes, what’s your current relationship

<p>You’re very <em>small</em> (around 1m tall), with <em>pointy
ears</em> and a <em>beard</em> – regardless of gender – and you’ve
always looked <em>old</em>. You used to live <em>underground</em>, and
you’re so used to the dark that you wear <em>sunglasses</em> everywhere.
Some people say you’re made of <em>stone</em>, but that’s just human
nonsense. But are you good with <em>tinkering</em> and
<em>engineering</em>, or is that also just a dumb stereotype? People say
your <em>pointy hats</em> are kitsch, but you know better. Take a

<em>Medium</em>, but something went wrong and it left you stuck as an
<strong>ectoplasm</strong>, unable to return to your physical body. What
happened? Is it hard to keep a coherent form? Can you interact with the
material world? Do you still feel your body as a <em>phantom limb</em>?

something like <em>lightning</em>, <em>void</em>, <em>plutonium</em>, or
whatever. What do you look like? Your appearance and personality are
believed to be <em>tied</em> to the element you embody. If so, what does

<p>You’re a <em>guardian</em> and a <em>healer</em>. You never died: you
just <em>disappeared</em> in the forest and never came back as your old
self. You transformed yourself, becoming part of <em>nature</em> itself.
Therefore, you can invoke its powers to aid those who call for your
help. Usually, those like you can only be seen in <em>dreams</em>, or
when summoned by <em>Shamans</em>, so why are you <em>physically</em>

OG <em>faerie</em>, <em>dark</em> and <em>amoral</em>? Are you small or
human-sized? You probably have <em>wings</em> and <em>pointy ears</em>,
but can you disguise yourself through <em>glamour</em>? Are you

<p>You were <em>discarded</em>. Unwanted. Broken. A <em>failure</em>.
Now you look for something to call your<em>self</em>. What were you

What went <em>wrong</em>, in the eyes of your creator? Do you know who

<p>Something about you looks kinda <em>fishy</em>. Maybe it’s your

your green-grayish, <em>hairless skin</em>. Do you have <em>webbing</em>
between your fingers, or <em>tentacles</em>, maybe a swordfish
<em>spear</em> on your head? Or the—wait, are those <em>gills</em>?
Whatever the case, you can live on land without a problem, but your home
is the <em>sea</em>. You can breathe underwater, and you swim faster
than you run. Were you born like this or did you transform later in
life? Are you a hybrid of some kind? Do you know others like you? Does
the sea call you? Have you ever seen the shining city of Y’ha-nthlei?
You can take a <strong>MAGIC TAG</strong> if you want, and don’t forget

<p>You’re way <em>older</em> than you look. The older a fox is, the more

tails do <em>you</em> have? Are you immortal? Are you in <em>human</em>
or <em>fox</em> shape most of the time? Do you have a favoured human
form you like to assume? Whatever it is, people will find it
<em>astonishing.</em> Do you take advantage of that to seduce them? Do
you retain any fox traits, like ears or tails, while passing for human?
Is it true that you need to wear a human skull over your head in order
to change shapes? Did you have a human person or family that you
protected with your magic? What happened to them? Are you a spirit, or a

anything with those <em>bodies</em> anymore. Before joining this group
you lived <em>underground</em> or in <em>abandoned</em> buildings as you
roamed in cemeteries and ate <em>carrion</em>. With your
<em>muzzle</em>, sharp <em>teeth</em> and <em>claws</em>, you’re also a
very good portrait <em>model</em>. Were you human once, or were you born
a ghoul? If once human, how did you become like this? Some Ghouls can
change their appearance to that of the last corpse they ate, or gain its
memories. Can you do that? Can you control yourself when you’re hungry?

<p>Above everything, you’re a <em>trickster</em>. Sure, you may curdle
the milk, kill some chicken to drink their blood, break a few windows,
but you also <em>fight the power</em>, usually with lots of flamboyance.
You’re tiny, black, and hop around dexterously with only one leg, all
while smoking whatever’s in your <strong>pipe</strong> – take it as a
HAVE tag, by the way. Your powers come from the red hood you never take
off your head, so write it as your <strong>MAGIC TAG</strong> and don’t
let anyone steal it from you.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.3.1.88">88. Sapient Fungus</h4>
<p>What’s within you is beyond anything that can be explained by
restrictive concepts like a <em>self</em>. Not because you are superior
to those who <em>do</em> have a self, it’s just not how it works for
you. You have always been and will always be nothing less and nothing
more than a <em>We</em>, each singular body a different manifestation of
a greater, collective being, a limitless mycelial conscience that
sprawls through space and time – even through your <em>current
comrades</em>, exposed as they are to your spores (decide
<em>together</em> how that may manifest). You can contain both magic
psychedelics and deadly toxins in your body, and, yes, you <em>are</em>
edible. And you cannot be killed in a way that matters. Write your tags
accordingly and take a <strong>MAGIC TAG</strong> if you please.</p>

<p>Sticks and stones may break your bones, but you sure hope they don’t.
And, by the way, do you still have all of dem bones in place? You spent
a long time working a useless job, guarding a forgotten ruin against
trespassers… until said trespassers <em>finally</em> managed to kill
everyone else, including your awful wizard boss. <em>Good riddance</em>,
really. You only escaped by sheer luck, and you knew in your bones it
was time for a change. What did you do then, and how did it lead you to
where you are now? Do you like dancing? What about playing an
instrument? Take your ancient <strong>sword</strong> from your old job
as a HAVE and the <strong>skills</strong> you learned after that as a

<p>You change <em>skins</em> like a human changes clothes. Naked, you
look like a typical <em>flayed</em> human, smearing blood all over the
floor. Wearing a skin, however, you can <em>fully transform</em> into
whatever <em>animal</em> wore it before, humans included. First,
however, you have to <em>acquire</em> and <em>prepare</em> said skins.
No, of course you can’t buy them ready-made, you gotta do all the

A hairless, <em>fanged freak</em> that kinda looks like a bat? A

<p>Come up with a <strong>name</strong> for the organisation you are

there any subdivisions? Are you just a dozen weirdos that got together
by chance, or maybe a sprawling decentralised network of independent
cells? How are decisions made? Are there leaders? Are you already in
<em>Their</em> sights, or are you still working in the shadows? If you
need inspiration, there’s a table below that can help you.</p>
<p>Ideally, each player could create one <strong>Non-Playable

group, but (as with all of these instructions, really) only <em>if</em>
you want to. There’s also a random table below to help you add some
interesting characters to your crew.</p>
<p>Something important to keep in mind is that your group is a

than the <em>roles</em> they fill in it. Try to keep that in mind and
imagine how both Player Characters and NPCs interact with each
other.</p>
<p><em>Don’t worry</em> about figuring it all out right now, just a

<strong>two</strong> <strong>highest</strong> values.</p>
<ul>
<li>A result of <strong>6 or less</strong> is either a
<strong>failure</strong> or a success with <strong>disastrous</strong>
or completely <strong>unexpected consequences</strong>, which the
Organizer decides.</li>
<li>A total of <strong>7 to 9</strong> is a “<strong>ok, but…</strong>”
narrated by the Organizer.</li>
<li><strong>10 or more</strong> means you did good and get to tell us
<strong>how</strong> you did it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat</strong> is <em>not</em> special. Just do the same
stuff as the other actions.</p>
<section id="ch001.xhtml#conditions" class="level3" data-number="1.6.1">
<h3 data-number="1.6.1">Conditions</h3>
<p>Whenever you fuck up, get hurt, or something happens to you that has
potentially lasting consequences, take a <strong>condition</strong> tag.
Some examples of conditions include: a <em>lasting headache</em>, a
<em>broken arm</em>, <em>nausea</em>, a really <em>loud &amp; squeaky
shoe</em>, a <em>horrible smell</em>, an <em>acid trip</em> - things
like that.</p>
<p>When making a <strong>roll</strong>, if a <strong>condition</strong>
could get in your way, roll <strong>3d6</strong> and use the
<strong>lowest values</strong>. If any of your <strong>tags</strong>
could help you out in this situation, they <strong>cancel</strong> each
other out and you just roll <strong>2d6</strong>.</p>
<p>You can have a maximum of <strong>3 conditions</strong> at once. You
can get rid of them by taking <em>narratively appropriate actions</em>
(as agreed by the group) or after you get to <em>rest</em> and enough
<em>time</em> has passed.</p>
<p>When you already have <strong>3 conditions</strong>, the
<strong>next</strong> time you should take one, roll a
<strong>d6</strong>. A <strong>5 or 6</strong> means you get to narrate
how you miraculously <strong>escape</strong> it. <strong>1 to 4</strong>
means either this condition or one of the previous 3 becomes
<strong>permanent</strong> and you’ll have to <strong>swap</strong> one
of your <strong>tags</strong> for it, with an appropriately dramatic
scene. The next time <em>another</em> condition becomes permanent, your
character either <strong>dies</strong>, <strong>gives up</strong> or, if
using the <em>optional</em> <strong>wants and needs</strong> rules,
<strong>swaps</strong> one of their <strong>wants</strong> to get rid of
this condition or one of their <strong>needs</strong> to learn to live
with it.</p>
</section>
<section id="ch001.xhtml#magic" class="level3" data-number="1.6.2">
<h3 data-number="1.6.2">Magic</h3>
<p>If you are a Magic user, give yourself a <strong>tag</strong> that
says you can use Magic, your <strong>MAGIC TAG</strong>. In return,
write down <strong>1d4 Magic Words</strong> from the <strong>d66
table</strong> below, representing spells that you can easily use.</p>
<p>If you cast a spell that uses one of those words in any significant
way, roll a <strong>d6</strong> for <strong>each</strong> word used and
keep the <strong>highest</strong>. This die is the measure of how well
you did:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>6</strong> means an <strong>awesome success</strong> and
you get an <strong>extra</strong> positive effect.</li>
<li>A <strong>4 or 5</strong> means you get <strong>exactly</strong>
what you wanted.</li>
<li>A <strong>2 or 3</strong> means you were just ok and the spell has a
<strong>lesser effect</strong> than you expected.</li>
<li>On a <strong>1</strong>, it goes horribly wrong and
<strong>backfires</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Be creative</em> about how you use your Magic Words.
<strong>Puns</strong> are not only allowed, but
<strong>encouraged</strong>, Magic likes wordplay for some reason.</p>
<p>Some specific backgrounds will suggest alternative ways of using the
Magic Words. For example, the <strong>Pyromancer</strong>’s powers are
like using Magic but only with the Magic Word <strong>FIRE</strong>.
<strong>Telepaths</strong> only have the Magic Words
<strong>MIND</strong> or <em><strong>EMOTION</strong></em>. This is a
<em>shortcut</em> for representing other supernatural powers that are
not exactly Magic while still allowing for failure and cleverness. You
can use those as examples for your own uncanny abilities. As with
everything else in this book, you don’t <em>have</em> to follow those
rules.</p>
<p><em>Beyond</em> the <strong>Magic Words</strong> that represent your
<strong>specialities</strong>, <strong>Magic is <em>playing dice with
the universe</em></strong>.</p>
<p>To cast a <strong>spell</strong>, <strong>say what you
<em>want</em></strong> to accomplish with it, think of <strong>what can
happen if it goes <em>wrong</em></strong>, <em>then</em>
<strong><em>wager</em> something in return</strong> for the power you
need.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the spell goes <strong>wrong</strong>, you <strong>don’t
lose</strong> whatever it is you wagered.</p></li>
<li><p>If it goes <strong>right</strong>, roll <strong>1d6</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the result is a number from <strong>1 to 4</strong>, you
<strong>lose</strong> the thing being wagered.</p></li>
<li><p>On a <strong>5 or 6</strong>, you can <strong>keep</strong> what
you gambled, but it’s somehow <em><strong>wrong</strong></em> now, as
part of its own <em>being</em> has been spent to power your
spell.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can bet <strong>anything</strong>, from magical artefacts to your
own soul, though souls are cheaper than they sound.</p>
<p>The higher your <strong>bet</strong>, the higher your
<strong>rewards</strong>. The <strong>weirder</strong> or more
<strong>emotionally significant</strong> your wager is to you, the more
<strong>complex</strong> or <strong>powerful</strong> the desired
effect.</p>
<p>If you bet one of your <strong>tags</strong>, which means betting a
piece of <em>yourself</em>, or something with <strong>similar
importance</strong> to your character (e.g., <em>going back to square
one on a want</em>, <em>sacrificing a loved one</em>), you
<strong>always succeed</strong>. Roll a <strong>d6</strong> just to see
<strong>how big</strong> your success was:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On a <strong>1 or 2</strong>, your success was barely
<strong>mediocre</strong>,</p></li>
<li><p>On a <strong>3 or 4</strong>, it was just
<strong>alright</strong>,</p></li>
<li><p>And on a <strong>5 or 6</strong>, it was
<strong>awesome</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>This die also says if you <strong>lose</strong> the tag (if your
result was from <strong>1 to 4</strong>) or if you <strong>keep</strong>
it but it’s all <em>wrong</em> now (on a <strong>5 or 6</strong>). Tell
everyone else how that happens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you bet an <strong>artefact</strong>, or something of similar
<strong>weird</strong> or <strong>supernatural</strong> properties, or
if you take a <strong>condition</strong>, you can cast the spell the
same way as with <strong>Magic Words</strong>. That means you roll a
<strong>d6</strong> for <strong>each</strong> thing you bet and take the
<strong>highest</strong> result. Each die also determines if you
<strong>lose</strong> the stuff you wagered or not.</p>
<p>For every other thing being gambled, decide among the table how
<strong>valuable</strong> it is <em>for your character</em>, on a scale
from <strong>1 to 5</strong>. Roll a <strong>d6 under or equal that
number</strong> to cast the spell. If the spell goes
<strong>wrong</strong>, you <strong>don’t lose</strong> whatever it is
you wagered. If it goes <strong>right</strong>, roll the
<strong>d6</strong> to see if you keep it (but changed) or lose it.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.6.3">Artefacts</h3>
<p>Artefacts are <strong>magical items</strong> with very
<strong>specific</strong> usages. They can also be sacrificed to fuel
spells.</p>
<p>You can start with <strong>one</strong> magical artefact <em>in
addition</em> to your <strong>HAVE</strong> tags. You can acquire more
during your journeys, up to <strong>3</strong> at once if you can use
Magic, and <strong>2</strong> if you don’t.</p>
<p>An artefact can have either a <strong>passive</strong> or
<strong>active</strong> effect.</p>
<p>Whenever you activate an <strong>active</strong>-effect artefact,
roll a <strong>d6</strong>. A result of <strong>5 or 6</strong> means
it’s <strong>depleted</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Passive</strong> artefacts <em>change you</em> over time.
Every consecutive <strong>day</strong> of using them, roll a
<strong>d6</strong>. A <strong>5 or 6</strong> means it has a random
unexpected <strong>side-effect</strong>, which you can decide.</p>

<section id="ch001.xhtml#the-bureau" class="level3" data-number="1.6.4">
<h3 data-number="1.6.4">The Bureau</h3>
<p>The Bureau are the People in <strong>Black Suits</strong> and
<strong>Dark Shades</strong>. You know the ones, and <em>they</em> know
<em>you</em> know. Careful, they may be watching you <em>right
now</em>.</p>
<p>The Bureau can also be known as The Agency, The Foundation, Los
Hermanos and other vague epithets like that. Their actual name probably
forms a <strong>3-letter acronym</strong>. They are the ones who seek to
preserve ‘<strong>normalcy</strong>’ at all costs:
<strong>containing</strong>, <strong>attacking</strong> and sometimes
<strong>exterminating</strong> everything they see as a threat to them.
They operate in <strong>secrecy</strong>, but their reach and
<strong>influence</strong> are vast.</p>
<p>Note that The Bureau is not inherently <em>evil</em>. Sometimes their
job becomes <strong>necessary</strong>: some supernatural or anomalous
objects, phenomena and beings do represent a <strong>threat</strong> to
others, <em>human or not</em>, and may need to be dealt with in some
way. The Bureau is <em>not</em> your ally, but that doesn’t mean it will
<em>always</em> be on the <strong>opposite</strong> side as you.</p>
<p>If you decide to use <strong>The Bureau</strong> in your game, think
about what your characters currently know about it. Are they on its
<em>radar</em>, and if so, do they <em>know</em>? Have they only heard
<em>rumours</em> and whispers about it, or are they in an open
<em>conflict</em> already? And what <em>is</em> The Bureau anyway? Is it
an <em>independent</em> organisation? A secret branch of a
<em>government</em>? Maybe an <em>international</em> task force under
the UN? Just the CIA? Is it restricted to <em>secret agent</em> types,
or does it have <em>military</em> or <em>scientific</em> assets at its
disposal? How <em>big</em> is its operation? You might treat them as
<em>cops</em>, as a vast <em>conspiracy</em>, as civil servants that
truly believe they <em>protect</em> the world against the forces of
darkness, as <em>all of the above</em>. Just remember to keep them as
<strong>shadowy</strong> as you can and that curiosity killed the
cat.</p>

<li>You find a small <strong>camera</strong> hidden inside your house.

class="level3" data-number="1.6.5">
<h3 data-number="1.6.5">The Watchers of the Many-Angled One</h3>
<p><strong>Neonazi occultists</strong>, guided by a resurrected
<strong>Julius Evola</strong>. Usually, they would be just your typical
nazi <em>punchable annoyance</em>, but now they’re toying with
<strong>dangerous</strong> forces that they don’t even comprehend. The
group is composed of a network of independent cells, coordinated by an
inner circle called the Lodge. Only a few people in the Lodge know about
Evola, who now goes by the name Father Enoch, the Watchers’ Master
Immortal.</p>
<p>The Watchers <strong>worship</strong> a <em>Something</em> they call
the <strong>Many-Angled One</strong>, which supposedly inhabits a
dimension simultaneously above and below our own, represented as a
shifting mass of straight lines crossing at impossible angles. Some call
it <em>Abhoth</em>, others <em>Choronzon</em>, but it is forbidden for
the Watchers to say or even know its True Name until one is deemed
<strong>worthy</strong>. You may guess what those guys think is
worthy.</p>
<p>As expected, they plan to <strong>summon</strong> the Many-Angled One
to our reality, to <strong>cleanse</strong> the Earth and give birth to
a new Aeon of triumph with their god’s guidance – ‘<em>triumph</em>’
here meaning White Men <strong>ruling</strong> not just our world, but
the whole solar system. In the meantime, they prepare for Its coming by
committing as many <strong>atrocities</strong> as they can. They believe
extreme acts of <strong>violence</strong> can awaken their innate
capacity to see the world from the nonhuman, polyangular perspective of
their Lord by <strong>transcending</strong> what they see as the human
<strong>weaknesses</strong> in them. Oh, and while they’re at it they
also use their little magical knowledge to try and make the world more
to their liking, associating with <em>paramilitary</em> and
<em>terrorist</em> groups, funding <em>Far-Right</em> parties and
pundits, hoarding <em>magical relics</em>, and trying to spread their
<em>beliefs</em> both <em>esoteric</em> and <em>political</em> as much
as they can. Some of them become <em>cops</em> and <em>military</em>
just so they can kill without consequences and offer those deaths as
<em>blood sacrifices</em> to their god. Some get into <em>politics</em>,
some into <em>finance</em>. There are probably sleeper Watchers inside
<em><strong>all</strong></em> <em>the other factions</em> detailed
here.</p>
<p>If you want to use <strong>the Watchers</strong> in your game,
<strong><em>don’t</em> worry</strong> about making them
<strong>complex</strong> antagonists; don’t worry about making them have
a <strong>point</strong>; don’t worry about making them
<strong>charismatic</strong>. <em>They don’t need any of that</em>.
They’re <strong>nazis</strong> that want to summon a <strong>cosmic
horror</strong>. Just <em>punch them</em> and be done with it.</p>

<li>You visit a friendly <strong>monster’s</strong> place just to find
them being <strong>assaulted</strong> by a group of frenzied people in
red, Klan-like robes. Before running away, they mutter something about
how they’ll soon <strong>get rid</strong> of ‘<em>your kind</em>’. You
ignore it at first, but many <strong>others</strong> get similarly
attacked in the following days.</li>
<li>A series of <strong>bombings</strong> take place in the city every
day precisely at <em>09:09</em>. At first, they look

bomb will be enough to <strong>complete</strong> it.</li>
<li>What seemed like just a ‘regular’ fascist <strong>rally</strong>
ends up with all attendees <strong>dead</strong>. The media blames
‘left-wing terrorists’, but those in the know whisper about a dangerous
<strong>ritual</strong> gone wrong. Which is not such a bad thing,
actually, good riddance and all that. But what if they get it
<strong>right</strong> <em>next</em> time?</li>
<li>A member of the <strong>Brotherhood of Thoth</strong> contacts you
in secret. Her son is <strong>missing</strong>. He had been hanging out
with a gang of Watchers. The day before, he performed a series of
innocuous actions that only a trained eye could see as
<strong>cleansing</strong> rituals, like the ones for
<strong>sacrifice</strong>. She’s pretty confident he’s a
<strong>virgin</strong> too. You can see where this goes. She wants you
to <strong>rescue</strong> him before word gets out and it tarnishes her
status.</li>
<li>You have the <strong>heist</strong> all planned. The target is an
auction-house <strong>storage</strong>, where a powerful
<strong>grimoire</strong> awaits to be sold to the highest bidder. You
fear it will fall in the wrong hands. When you arrive, the wrong hands
are already there: fucking Watchers, almost done cracking the
<strong>safe</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>grave</strong> of a friend’s grandmother, a
<strong>witch</strong>, was dug up, and her <strong>corpse</strong>
stolen. A <strong>swastika</strong> was graffitied on her gravestone. No
one seems to care, especially the police. But the binder full of
clippings your friend gives you points at something larger: evidence of
<em>other</em> witches’ graves being robbed all over the country for the
past year. Interestingly, <em>all</em> of them were tagged with nazi
shit nearby too.</li>

<h3 data-number="1.6.6">The Brotherhood of Thoth</h3>
<p>They’re very, <em>very</em> <strong>rich</strong>, therefore they’re
complete <strong>assholes</strong>. <strong>Hoarders</strong> that call
themselves collectors. <strong>Robbers</strong> that call themselves
scholars. Some are in it for <strong>knowledge</strong>, others for
<strong>power</strong>, others for <strong>fun</strong>. Many are just
there <em>because they can</em>.</p>
<p>They gather in <strong>sumptuous</strong> places like mansions and
country estates, surrounded by pictures of dead people and priceless
<strong>artefacts</strong>. They show each other their new acquisitions,
their weird <strong>theories</strong>, and their future plans. They
<strong>feast</strong> on the flesh of sentient magical creatures,
cooked with the most expensive ingredients.</p>
<p>The Brotherhood is like every typical <strong>occultist
society</strong> that popped up across the last couple of centuries. A
bunch of rich guys (yes, they’re usually guys) with too much time on
their hands. It’s about <em><strong>ownership</strong></em>, in the end.
They desire to learn the <strong>secrets</strong> of the world just to
reassert their <strong>power</strong> over it.</p>
<p>If you want to use <strong>the Brotherhood</strong> in your game,
think about <del>how rich people are bastards</del> how they would see
your characters. If you’re <em>human</em>, do they see you as
<em>inferior</em> because of <strong>class</strong> or as <em>peers</em>
in <strong>knowledge</strong>? If not, do they find you
<em>amusing</em>, <em>dangerous</em>, maybe <em>useful</em>? Or maybe

investigation leads you to a huge mansion where a <strong>feast</strong>
is taking place. You soon find out where your friend is: <em>the

<li>A group of <strong>priests</strong> from a secret and ancient faith
ask for your help in returning an <strong>artefact</strong> stolen from
their people by a white ‘<strong>professor</strong>’ a long time ago.
You’re not surprised to discover who the guy was. They even made

along with his famous hat and whip, as a gift to decorate one of the

odd that every single kid there seems to always be

<li>One of the <em>secret</em> and <em>private</em> boarding

by a couple of <strong>loud lesbian lizards</strong>, the Pub is always

<strong>geas</strong> forbids <em>anyone</em> from
<strong>fighting</strong> inside it, so it also functions as a

<em>as long as</em> there’s <strong>alcohol</strong> in your
bloodstreams.</li>
<li>In the <strong>smoking lounge</strong>, behind the <strong>snooker
table</strong>, propped on a tower of pillows, you can usually find
<strong>The Dragon</strong>, smoking a <strong>hookah</strong> and
playing <strong>mahjong</strong>. Actually a <strong>giant
caterpillar</strong>, they’ve embraced the once ironic nickname. The
Pub’s rules forbid them from conducting <strong>business</strong> here,
but if you ever need them, this is where you’ll have your first meeting.
Their offer is very simple: they’ll do <em>you</em> a
<strong>favour</strong> if you do <em>them</em> a
<strong>favour</strong>.</li>
<li>There’s a <strong>phone booth</strong> in the corner that
<strong>teleports</strong> you to where you
<em><strong>need</strong></em> to go, but <em>only</em> if you’re
<strong>drunk</strong> enough. And <em>it</em> <strong>decides</strong>
the destination for you.</li>
<li>If you <em>somehow</em> end up with <strong>no clothes</strong>,
don’t worry! The Pub offers a free supply of <strong>Pixie Goo</strong>
that you can rub on your skin and make it <strong>look</strong> like
you’re <strong>wearing</strong> anything you can imagine, from tatters
to silk. <em><strong>Visuals</strong></em> <em>only</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Beast</strong>. You have <em>heard</em> about it, but
<em>always</em> <strong>forget</strong> it as soon as you leave.
Everyone says something <strong>completely different</strong> about it,
every time. Well, <em>you</em> have heard it is actually the one
<strong>in charge</strong> here.</li>
<li>If you’re ever in need of <strong>ideas</strong> of any kind,
<strong>The</strong> <strong>Contraband Rimer</strong> can help you. But
don’t ask them <strong>where</strong> their goods are smuggled from, and
be careful: sometimes they’re <strong>potent</strong> enough to change
<em>everything</em>.</li>
<li>You can probably find the <strong>Mechanical Eve</strong> in a
corner, nursing a full glass of brandy she’ll never actually drink in
her <em>robotic</em> hand. If you sit beside her she’ll tell you she’s
looking for a <strong>child</strong>. <em>Any</em> child will do. Hers
is all <em>grown up</em> now, you see, and she needs to take care of
<em>someone</em>. It’s what she believes she was
<em><strong>made</strong></em> <em>for</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Viking</strong> is a <em>balding</em>, <em>middle-aged
guy</em> with a dad bod dressed in unnecessarily
<strong>realistic</strong> viking clothes who was cursed to speak
<em>only</em> through <strong>bad jokes</strong>. He claims to be an
<strong>actual</strong> viking, somehow displaced in time and
<strong>stranded</strong> here, but his curse makes it so no one can
know for sure if that’s true.</li>

<h3 data-number="1.7.2">The Night Market</h3>
<p>Every night, just after the stars come out, in a large <strong>trap
street</strong> you can only find if you <em>know</em> what to look for,
the Night Market takes place. Dozens of vendors set their stalls there,
selling everything imaginable, from rare potion
<strong>ingredients</strong> to <strong>smuggled</strong> magical
<strong>artefacts</strong>. Money is not usually accepted here, as
<strong>bartering</strong> is the preferred form of currency. The Market
is organised by a rotating <strong>council</strong> of merchants who
keep an eye on everyone. <strong>Theft</strong> is harshly
<em>punished</em>. <strong>Haggling</strong> is
<em>recommended</em>.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.7.2.1">STALLS AT THE NIGHT MARKET</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>In a nondescript <strong>gutter</strong> behind two food stalls,
there’s a nameless <strong>centipede</strong> nest. If you say the right
<strong>password</strong>, they will give you <em>any</em>
<strong>hallucinogen</strong> you’re looking for, in exchange for
<em>just</em> a little sample of your <strong>DNA</strong>.</li>
<li>An oversized <strong>tent</strong> made of black fabric, the words
‘<strong>Vampire Noodles</strong>’ freshly scrawled on it in dark fluid.
You can hear loud <strong>slurping</strong> noises coming from
inside.</li>
<li><strong>The Body Shop</strong>, where you can find a wide variety of
<em>homegrown</em>, <em>handcrafted</em>, <em>100% organic</em>
<strong>body parts</strong> for as cheap as your <strong>last</strong>
<strong>memory</strong> of a <em>lost love</em>.</li>
<li>An <strong>old man</strong> standing beside a
<strong>suitcase</strong>. A sign in front of it says ‘<strong>Necessary
Stuff</strong>.’ He can take out of his suitcase _<strong>any*
item</strong> you ask for. In return, he will <em>just</em> ask you for
a <em>small</em> <strong>favour</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>chaotic stall</strong>, full of what looks like random
<strong>junk</strong> at first, tended by someone who’s pretty obviously
<strong>three goblins in a trenchcoat</strong>. A sign oddly says
<strong>’NOT BOOMBZ</strong>’. Looking closer you can see that
<em>every</em> <em>single</em> <em>item</em> on display is actually a
<strong>bomb</strong>. Tonight they have explosive
<strong>bonsai</strong>, explosive <strong>candy</strong>, and explosive
<strong>self-help books</strong> on sale.</li>
<li>The <strong>Dollmaker</strong> is a doll <em>themselves</em>, but
you should <em>never</em> point this out. They have
<strong>dolls</strong> of <strong>all kinds</strong> on display: creepy
<strong>puppets</strong>, <strong>voodoo</strong> dolls,
<strong>sex</strong> dolls, <strong>rag</strong> dolls,
<strong>cursed</strong> dolls, and a giant <strong>yellow</strong>
<strong>bird</strong> that looks terrified and sometimes seems to follow
you with its eyes.</li>

<h3 data-number="1.7.3">The Library</h3>
<p>The Library is said to be <strong>infinite</strong>. It <em>is</em>,
at least, <strong>enormous</strong>. There you can find not only
<strong>books</strong> but all kinds of archival
<strong>records</strong>. <strong>People</strong>,
<strong>not-people</strong> and <strong>once-people</strong> of all
kinds come here from all over, but it <em>never</em> feels noisy or
crowded. The <strong>Librarians</strong>, with their
<strong>unblinking</strong> stares, seem to be <em>everywhere</em> and
<em>nowhere</em> at once. This comes in handy, for anyone can easily get
<strong>lost</strong> in the <strong>labyrinthine</strong> corridors
without their help. Just <em>don’t</em> <strong>damage</strong> the
books: they are rumoured to <strong>eat</strong> whoever does that.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.7.3.1">THINGS YOU CAN READ AT THE LIBRARY</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Exquisite Umbras</em> (202x), by <strong>Wendy Wo and Dr. Franky
N. Further (org.)</strong>. A collection of weird and horrifying
<strong>true</strong> <strong>tales</strong> <strong>of terror</strong>
compiled from rumours, whispers, first-hand accounts and stunning
photographic evidence.</li>
<li><em>The Truest Bible</em> (????), <strong>unknown
writer(s)</strong>. A collection of texts <strong>similar</strong> in
style and content to the Christian <strong>Bible</strong>, but seemingly
far more <strong>ancient</strong>. It consists of an
<strong>alternate</strong> <strong>history</strong> of the world,
beginning with the creation of <strong>Woman</strong> by breaking her
own rib and ending with the <strong>Fall of Man</strong> and the
beginning of <strong>Paradise</strong> for everyone else after His
fall.</li>
<li>The only remaining copies of <em>The Dragons of Super
Friendship</em> (2018-2019), a <strong>cartoon</strong> that rapidly
attracted a passionate adult <strong>fandom</strong>. Described as
‘<strong>wholesome</strong>’ and ‘<strong>cozy</strong>’, it was praised
for its <strong>conflict-free</strong> story and good queer
<strong>representation</strong>. But then the <strong>murders</strong>
started.</li>
<li><em>My Year as an Ant</em> (1649), by <strong>Roberto
Latonta</strong>. The unfinished memoir of XVII century explorer Roberto
Figueroa Latonta, documenting his life among the Giant Ants of the lost
underground city of <strong>Hormiguero</strong>.</li>
<li>The <em>Audiovisual Records Archive</em> somehow holds
<em>actual</em> <strong>footage</strong> of the <strong>death</strong>
and <strong>birth</strong> of <em>every</em> single human being, but
those are usually <strong>restricted</strong>. You’re allowed to watch
<strong>yours</strong>, though it isn’t advised — <em>especially</em>
your birth.</li>
<li><em>An untitled spiral bound notebook with a yellow cover</em>
(c. 2010), <strong>unknown writer</strong>. Contains six
<strong>pornographic</strong> stories around an entity known only as
<em><strong>The King in Yellow</strong></em>. All the stories seem to
have been printed from popular <strong>fanfiction</strong> website
<em>Archive of Our Own</em>, but no such records exist in the site
itself. Possible effects on the reader include <strong>nausea</strong>,
<strong>arousal</strong> and <strong>unwilling
teleportation</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Waste Not, Want Not, vol. II: Fun with Fluids</em> (1949), by
<strong>Montgomery Jeffreys</strong>. Part of a seven-volume collection
of cookbooks about how to prepare <strong>homemade</strong> food from
<strong>corpses</strong>. This one focuses on creative ways to make use
of the wide variety of <strong>fluids</strong> found in the human
body.</li>
<li>An <em>unlabelled vinyl record</em> (c. 1970) consisting of 22
minutes and 13 seconds of <strong>silence</strong> intercut with
<strong>static</strong>, after there is a faint
<strong>whisper</strong>. <em>Everyone</em> hears it say something
<strong>different</strong>, but it’s <em>always</em> a
<strong>threat</strong> and it <em>always</em> comes
<strong>true</strong>.</li>
<li>The <em>blueprints for a prototype</em> (c. 1500), attributed to
<strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong>, containing details for building a
fully <strong>functional</strong> <strong>giant</strong> (5m)
<strong>robot</strong> with only easily available materials.</li>
<li><em>The White Woodpecker Farm</em> (1918). A discarded children’s
novel draft by author <strong>Monteiro Lobato</strong>, later reworked
as his <em>Yellow Woodpecker</em> series. The book is set in an idyllic
<strong>farm</strong>, presumably in rural Brazil. Through a string of
loosely related vignettes, it follows the <strong>adventures</strong> of
children Lucia and Pete as they travel to other <strong>worlds</strong>,
make <strong>friends</strong>, burn <strong>crosses</strong>, and commit
<strong>genocide</strong>.</li>

<p>Mrs. Li sells <strong>herbs</strong>, <strong>potions</strong> and

centimetre of this small store is packed with stuff that’s completely
unrelated to each other. She specialises in not having a
<em>singular</em> speciality, which is really quite
<strong>useful</strong> for her clientele. If you’re ever in need of
something very <strong>specific</strong>, <strong>unusual</strong>, or

<li>The best artisanal <strong>belladonna</strong> <strong>beer</strong>

<li><strong>Pickled</strong> <strong>eyeballs</strong>, very good
against migraines. Gluten-free.</li>

<li><strong>Sunglasses</strong> that show the wearer the

of them. Currently <strong>deactivated</strong> due to
Capitalism-Induced Overload, but still look pretty
<strong>cool</strong>.</li>
<li>A plain-looking <strong>key</strong>. It can <strong>open</strong>
<em>any</em> lock of its size, but <em>always</em> gets

<li><strong>The Best Jokes of All Time, v. 13: Yo Mama Edition</strong>.
Recite any incantation from this book to make whoever hears it enter a
